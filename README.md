Description The RDSDatabaseConnector project is a simple Python script that allows for the extraction of data from a PostgreSQL database, particularly an RDS instance. The aim of the project is to demonstrate how to use SQLAlchemy and Pandas to connect to a PostgreSQL database, fetch data, and save it to a CSV file. This project is an educational exercise in database connectivity, data extraction, and Python programming.

Installation Clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to the project directory. Install the required Python packages if you haven't. You can install them using pip: pip install pandas sqlalchemy pyyaml Create a credentials.yaml file in the project directory and populate it with your PostgreSQL RDS instance credentials. The YAML file should have the following structure: RDS_HOST: 'your_host' RDS_PORT: 'your_port' RDS_DATABASE: 'your_database' RDS_USER: 'your_username' RDS_PASSWORD: 'your_password'

Usage Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the script using Python: python db_utils.py Replace your_script_name.py with the actual name of the Python script. A CSV file named customer_activity.csv containing data from the customer_activity table in your PostgreSQL database will be generated in the project directory.
